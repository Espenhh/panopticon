panopticon is a monitoring system for all your applications that is dead simple to install and use. 

**You are just four simple steps away from using panopticon in production:**

1. Install panopticon on a server / in the cloud
1. Include the panopticon client in your application (or use the API directly)
1. Write your first measurement
1. Your application is now listed in your personal dashboard! ðŸŽ‰

## Configure AWS

Install `aws`, `eb` and `ansible` command line tools:

```
brew install aws
brew install eb
brew install ansible
```

Configure a AWS profile for panopticon:


`~.aws/credentials`

```
[panopticon]
aws_access_key_id = <ADD YOURS HERE>
aws_secret_access_key = <ADD YOURS HERE>
```

Run `eb init --profile panopticon` in `/backend`
